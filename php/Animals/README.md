# MT code assessment

This project is prepared by Michael Tanjung on February 3rd 2019 as a code assignment for X company to demonstrate PHP OOP best practices.

# Notes
- Echo(s) will have PHP_EOL appended so it look nice on the terminal. Unit tests updated accordingly.
- Documentation on the class(es), most of them are not needed (properties, setters and getters for example). The code is self explanatory, so there is no need really to add documentation on every single methods. I just added it for this excercise.
- Always use triple equals (===) equality comparison operator where possible.

# Requirements
- PHP 7.2+, since 7.1 is now supported for critical security issues only per http://php.net/supported-versions.php 
- PHPUnit 8 (requires PHP 7.2+)
- Composer (optional). I have included the vendor folder just in case

# Coding standard
- Coding style guide: PSR-2
- StudlyCaps for class name
- camelCase() for methods
- camelCase for properties and variables
- Filename must match class name where applicable

# Things to improve on
- Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to avoid SQL injection
- Add more test cases to AnimalTest

# Folder structure
```
